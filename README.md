_Learning Objective: demonstrate an understanding of basic variables and output applied to DACA article_

You're working for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office and are in charge of a project to create quick-print replacements for Employment Authorization Cards. In case someone has their card stolen or is lost, they can come into the office and receive a low-resolution print that will be honored until your replacement card is mailed out.

One of the interns on the team just got the template back to you [see Main.java](./Main.java). It's your job to complete the prototype before submitting it, fully documented, to the project manager.

**Given:**

- ASCII art and structure for an Employment Authorization Card (EAC)
- Documentation at the top and `main` method section headings

**Definitions:**

- ASCII art: graphic design technique using computer characters to draw images. For example, `\(^-^)/`
- Unicode: Universal Coded Character Set (like ASCII but _way_ bigger!) Can use them using escape character `\u` followed by a Unicode value, but much simpler/more readable to just copy/paste character into code
- Box Drawing Unicode characters: [https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/box-drawing/ (explore website later for more!)](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/box-drawing/)

**Lab ToDo:**

1. Complete program documentation at the top (lines 1-4) [this is how the project manager will know when and who completed the prototype]
2. Create appropriate variables, in the appropriate section of the `main` method, to store data from EAC [this is how the backend team will know what kind of data and names to use for the database that will store over 700,000 DACA recipients information]. You can fill in the data with one of your partners or some sample data.
3. Substitute ██ parts with data from variables you created [this will eventually be upgraded to pull from a database and store the data into the variables you created, so this flexibility is key for scaling up]
4. Ensure you are following all coding convention/style and documentation practices

**Once you have completed the lab, commit your changes and push your repository to turn in your work. There are <ins>no tests</ins> to run for this lab.**

Done with the lab above? Only then can you attempt the....

**!!!!!Hacker Challenge!!!!!**

- Close off the right side of the card (note this will depend on the values you have for your variables, that's ok!)
- Upgrade ASCII art and/or look of EAC (checkout Unicode webpage link above)
